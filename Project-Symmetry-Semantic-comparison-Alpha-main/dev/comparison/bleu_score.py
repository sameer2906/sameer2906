'''
Iterates over the source and the target articles sentence by sentence and 
uses BLEU Score to determine whether two sentences have a similarity score
GREATER OR EQUAL to the chosen similarity score.

More information of BLEU Score can be found at https://www.nltk.org/index.html

param:
    source: Article in a users native language
    target: Same article as source but in another language
    colors: randomly generated list of colors for highlighting
    similarity: similarity score that will be used to determine matching sentences
return:
    dictionaries of the form:
        {
            "sentence": ["matching sentence", "highlight color"],
            ...
        }
    source_pair_dict:   dictionary with sentences from source as key and value as a list containing matching sentences
                        from target and color to be highlighted
    target_pair_dict:   dictionary with sentences from target as key and value as a list containing matching sentences
                        from source and color to be highlighted
