Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson ([ˈbɒrɪs ˈd͡ʒɒnsən])Note 2 (born 19 June 1964) is an American statesman. He is leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2022.

After his studies, he became known as a journalist in the major British dailies. A member of the Conservative Party, he was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election in Henley, Oxfordshire, and re-elected at the 2005 general election. From 2015, he was elected for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Greater London).

In 2008, he resigned from Parliament following his election as mayor of London against the incumbent mayor, Labour's Ken Livingstone, against whom he was re-elected in 2012. His mandate was marked by the 2012 Summer Olympics, a decrease in crime and poverty, the prohibition of alcohol consumption on public transport, the introduction of a new generation of buses and Santander bicycles (known as "Boris Bikes"), as well as the defence of London's financial sector and the promotion of the construction of a new airport for the capital.  in the Thames estuary. He did not seek a third term in 2016.

Opposing the majority of Conservative Party personalities, he is one of the main figures in the camp in favour of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union ("Brexit"), which won in the referendum on 23rd June 2016. He was then appointed Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in Theresa May's government. Disagreeing with her over the conduct of Brexit, he resigned in 2018.

The following year, elected leader of the Conservative Party against Jeremy Hunt, he succeeded Theresa May as Prime Minister. With his attempts to quickly exit the EU thwarted by the British Parliament, he called a snap election to secure a parliamentary majority in favour of a withdrawal agreement. The Conservatives having obtained their largest number of elected representatives since 1987, Boris Johnson leads in January 2020 the realization of Brexit, which is followed by a trade agreement with the EU. He also has to manage the Covid-19 pandemic and face multiple controversies, some of which involve him personally, including that of Partygate, and which lead many members of the government to resign. To resolve this political crisis, he resigned, Liz Truss succeeding him after three years in office.

An eccentric personality, Boris Johnson is a controversial figure in British politics3. His supporters praised him as humorous and entertaining, with an appeal that extended beyond traditional conservative voters.4

Origins and youth[edit| code edit]
Birth and ancestors[edit| code]

George II, ascendant of the Johnsons.

Ali Kemal, Ottoman Home Secretary in 1919 and Boris Johnson's paternal great-grandfather.

Stanley Johnson, father of Boris Johnson.
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on June 19, 1964 in the Upper East Side of New York City. According to the Anglo-Saxon practice of using a surname in the composition of first names, the intermediate name "de Pfeffel" was given to him in tribute to the family of his great-grandfather Christian Hubert, baron de Pfeffel (1843-1922), father of Marie-Louise de Pfeffel (1882-1944), married to Stanley Fred Williams (1880-1955), and grandfather of Irene Williams (1907-1987) — herself paternal grandmother of Boris Johnson.

His birth was registered by both the American authorities and the British consulate in the city, which granted him both American and British citizenship. His parents are both British. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 20165.

His father, Stanley Johnson (born 1940 in Penzance, United Kingdom), moved to the United States to study creative writing at the University of Iowa, before studying economics at Columbia University in New York. He married Charlotte Mary Offlow Fawcett (born 1942 in Oxford) in 1963, with whom he had Boris Johnson and three other children. He divorced in the late 1980s and remarried Jennifer Kidd with whom he had two more children. He worked at the World Bank, became interested in the environment and worked at the Directorate-General for the Environment in Brussels from 1984 to 19946. In 1983 he received the RSPCA Richard Martin Award for service to the animal cause and in 1984 he received an award from Greenpeace for outstanding service to the environment. He is UNEP's ambassador for the Conservation of Migratory Animal Species based in Bonn. He has published a number of books on environmental issues and novels, including The Commissioner, made into a film in 1998 with actor John Hurt. In 1962, Stanley Johnson won the Newdigate Prize for poetry.

Stanley Johnson's father, Osman and then Wilfred "Johnny" Johnson (1909-1992), was born to an English and Swiss mother, born Winifred Emma Mary Brun (1883-1910), and Ali Kemal Bey (1867-1922), of Turkish origin, journalist and minister to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, killed for his anti-nationalist sympathies during the Turkish War of Independence. After his mother's death in 1910, shortly after giving birth, a year-old Osman was placed in the care of his English maternal grandmother, Margaret Brun, née Johnson, with whom he was renamed Wilfred "Johnny" Johnson. He died in Taunton Deane, Somerset.

Stanley Johnson's mother was born Irene de Pfeffel Williams (1907-1987). She was the daughter of Stanley Fred Williams (1880 in London-1955), of British descent, and Marie Louise de Pfeffel (1882 in Paris-1944), of French maternal descent (granddaughter of Jules Arnous de Rivière), and descended by her father Christian Hubert, Baron de Pfeffel (1843-1922), of the Alsatian family of Pfeffel and probably of the German royal family of Württemberg. She was, in fact, the granddaughter of Karoline von Rothenburg, herself said to be the illegitimate daughter of Prince Paul Charles of Württemberg. Pfeffel Williams' Irene is thus a great-great-granddaughter of the latter and, through him, a descendant of King George II of Great Britain. By this ancestry, Boris Johnson would be related to most of the royal families of Europe and would be a distant cousin of former Prime Minister David Cameron.

Boris Johnson's mother, Charlotte Mary Offlow Fawcett (born 1942 in Oxford), came from a family of left-wing liberal intellectuals. She married Stanley Johnson, whom she met in Oxford while studying English literature in 1963 before accompanying him to the United States. She became a professional painter. She remarried in 1988 to Nicholas Wahl, an American political scientist specializing in France, from whom she became a widow in 1996.

Charlotte Offlow Fawcett's father was Sir James Fawcett (1913-1991), a lawyer and member of the European Commission of Human Rights, which he chaired from 1972 to 1981; He was knighted in 1984.

Charlotte Offlow Fawcett's mother was Frances Beatrice Lowe (1913-2001), an American whose parents were academics Elias Avery Lowe, of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and Helen Tracy Porter, translator of Thomas Mann.

Boris Johnson's uncle is Edmund Fawcett (born 1946), younger brother of Charlotte Offlow Fawcett and writer and journalist from 1973 to 2003 for The Economist.

Boris Johnson is the eldest of four siblings who include Rachel Johnson, journalist and one-time editor of The Lady magazine, born in 1965; Leo Johnson, film director and entrepreneur, born in 1967; and Jo Johnson, columnist for the Financial Times, born in 1971, MP and several times Conservative minister. His godmother is the British author Rachel Billington7.

Early life[edit| code]
When Johnson was born, Johnson's parents lived in an apartment across the street from the Chelsea Hotel,8 and were soon embarked on a trip to Canada, New Hampshire and Vermont with their newborn baby.

In September 1964, the family returned to Britain, allowing Charlotte to resume her studies in English literature at Oxford University. There, she and her son lived in an apartment in Summertown, Oxford; it was there that she gave birth in 1965 to a daughter, Rachel. In July 1965, the family moved to Crouch End in North London and in February 1966 to Washington, where Stanley got a job at the World Bank.8 The parents have a third child, Leo, born in September 1967. Charlotte taught herself painting and became known. Stanley was fired and got a new job, which forced him and his family to travel to Harbor Island in Norwalk, Connecticut.

As a child, he was calm and studious. He suffered from serious deafness problems and had to undergo, at the age of eight, several operations, including the implantation of tympanic tubes8. He later said: "When I was a child I was extremely buttoned, extremely nerdy and terribly studious. My idea for a perfect day was to travel around London by tube to visit the British Museum. »

In the summer of 1969, the family returned to the UK, settling in a country house on Stanley's family farm in Nethercote, near Winsford in Exmoor. The country house is adjacent to a house inhabited by Stanley's parents, Johnny and Irene Johnson. Stanley is regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Boris alone.

Studies[edit| code change]
In 1973, his father became an official at the European Commission. The family then lived in Uccle (Brussels), and Alex Johnson was a student at the European School of Brussels I, where he learned French9. In 1975, he returned with his mother to London and continued his education at Ashdown House Preparatory School. In 1977, he entered Eton College10 as a scholar, where he began to develop his eccentric personality and call himself "Boris" (his middle name) rather than Alex.

In 1983 he was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied classics and philosophy. There he was elected president of the Oxford Union, where he rubbed shoulders with future Conservative Party figures David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Nick Boles. Because of his background and background, he is generally perceived as a member of traditional British high society ("upper class").

Privacy and family[edit| code]
Boris Johnson married Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987, but the marriage did not last a year and was annulled in 1993. That same year, he married Marina Wheeler, a lawyer and later Queen's Counsel, and daughter of journalist and producer Charles Wheeler and his second Sikh wife, Dip Singh, whose family originated in Punjab and immigrated to England after partition in 1947. The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for several decades, Marina Wheeler being at the European School in Brussels at the same time as her future husband. They had four children (Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo).11

In 2009, Stephanie was born from her affair with Helen MacIntyre, an art consultant. The latter took legal action to maintain secrecy about the identity of the father, but the Court of Appeal dismissed it in 2013, considering that this identity was in the public interest for voters12.

In September 2018, his affair with Carrie Symonds, press secretary and director of communications for the Conservative Party, was revealed to the general public and caused a scandal. Boris Johnson begins divorce proceedings with Marina Wheeler. On February 29, 2020, her relationship with Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, was formalized.13,14 They have two children: a son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, born April 29, 2020, and a daughter, Romy Iris Charlotte Johnson, born December 9, 202115. The couple married discreetly on May 29, 2021, in the Catholic Cathedral of Westminster, during a ceremony celebrated by Father Daniel Humphreys16,17.

Journalistic career[edit| code]

Boris Johnson in 2006.
Boris Johnson began his career as a trainee correspondent for The Times, but was sacked after a year for falsifying a quote from his godfather, Sir Colin Lucas. After a short stint at Wolverhampton Express & Star, he joined The Daily Telegraph in 1987. He was the Europe correspondent in Brussels from 1989 to 1994, then deputy editor from 1994 to 1999. He also worked for the conservative magazine The Spectator, first as a political columnist between 1994 and 1995, and then from 1999 as editor-in-chief18. He surprised the magazine's readership by publishing an interview with Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the French presidential election in 200218. In December 2005, he joined the shadow cabinet with responsibility for higher education.

His articles are often sensational and controversial.19 The comments he reports are sometimes taken out of context and used by his political opponents19. Her papers, which often denounced the failings of the leaders of the European institutions, particularly pleased Margaret Thatcher20. Le Monde wrote about him: "His cringing papers on the Commission and its president Jacques Delors earned him fame. He became the spokesman of Euroscepticism thanks to his acerbic pen and humour. He delights in mocking the European standardization of condoms, stigmatizes the "war" of Brussels "against British chips flavor cocktail of shrimp". Even if this exclusive information was sometimes the fruit of his imagination — he falsely attributed to Jacques Delors the intention of being elected President of Europe — he amused himself by pulling the strings, caused a scandal and became the darling of conservative circles"21.

Boris Johnson is the author of three books featuring his articles or columns: Johnson's Column, Lend Me Your Ears and Have I Got Views For You. He also published a novel, Seventy-Two Virgins in 2004.

It was nominated for a British Academy Television Award in 2004. He produced a documentary series, The Dream of Rome, comparing the Roman Empire and the European Union today, broadcast in 2006.

Political career[edit| edit code]
Member of the House of Commons[edit| amend Code]
In 1997, he was defeated in the parliamentary elections in the constituency of Clwyd South. In 2001, Johnson successfully entered the House of Commons, elected for the riding of Henley-on-Thames, succeeding Michael Heseltine. He recounted the campaign in a book Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump. In 2004, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Culture in a minor reshuffle following the resignation of Nick Hawkins. In November 2003, he was appointed Vice-President of the Conservative Party, after an intense campaign.

Boris Johnson was removed from the party in November 2004, following accusations of lies from Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair he allegedly had with Petronella Wyatt, The Spectator's New York correspondent and former assistant editor. Johnson ridiculed the allegations as "an inverted pyramid of nonsense" but Howard fired Johnson not because of the substance of the case itself but because he thought, from what the press was saying, that Boris Johnson had lied.

He was reappointed to the Shadow Cabinet responsible for higher education on 9 December 2005 by the new leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron. He resigned as editor of the Spectator shortly thereafter.

Mayor of London[edit| code]
He became Mayor of London following the election of 1 May 2008, defeating the incumbent Labour's Ken Livingstone, when the election initially seemed to be a foregone conclusion22. He was re-elected against the latter23 four years later24,25. He was admitted "keys to the city" ("Freeman of the City of London"26), which allowed him to stand for election as Lord Mayor of London if he wished.

In 2013, Boris Johnson opposed the capping of bonuses for European traders and bankers, particularly those in the City of London27.

He took over several projects from his predecessor: self-service bicycles (nicknamed the "Boris bike"), the Crossrail project, investments in transport and launched a new model of double-decker buses, modern and ecological. During his tenure, the Olympic Games were held. His popularity went beyond the simple Conservative Party.22

He regained his seat at the 2015 general election, being elected in the constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, seven years after deciding to leave the House of Commons due to his election as Mayor of London. He did not seek a third term and left London Mayor on 5 May 2016, with Labour's Sadiq Khan succeeding him.

Brexit campaign[edit| change code]

Boris Johnson in 2016.
While a profession of faith – signed by him two days before – glorified the "windfall" that would be a vote in favour of remaining in the Union and announced an "economic shock" in the event of Brexit21, he made an about-face on 21 February 2016 by taking a position for the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("Brexit"). Opposing the majority of Conservative Party personalities, he became one of the main figures in the Brexit campaign28,29, which won in the referendum on 23rd June 2016.

He appears to be one of the big winners of the election and is the favourite to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, who has announced his intention to resign before October30,31. But he had to face criticism over his ability to rally and finally gave up standing for the leadership of the Conservative Party32, very divided after this referendum, and supported the candidacy of Andrea Leadsom33.

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs[edit| amend code]
On 13th July 2016 Theresa May succeeded David Cameron as head of government. Boris Johnson joins his cabinet in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office34. His appointment provoked surprise or consternation in the media.35 He promises that his country "will always be part of Europe", that the rights of Europeans living in the UK will be "fully protected", that cooperation with the European Union "will intensify in the arts, sciences and universities" and that Britain will have access to the European single market, while insisting on the need to break with the European Union.  an institution that he considers "infantilizing"21. A supporter of a "clean" line, he intends to "liberate" his country from certain fiscal, ethical, customs and environmental rules, considering Brexit as "a considerable opportunity" to turn to new economic forces, such as the "Asia-Pacific region", and to take the lead in areas such as innovation and research36.

Her positions and reversals provoked criticism and embarrassment from foreign diplomats and the Prime Minister37. Germany's Frank-Walter Steinmeier reportedly compared him to one of those "irresponsible politicians who lure the country into Brexit and then let it go." Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, accused him of promising "what is intellectually impossible" and "politically unavailable". For Le Monde, "Boris Johnson continues to behave at the head of the Foreign Office like the troublemaker, often rude and dishonest, that he was when he was a journalist, then mayor of London." The Guardian accuses him of "sowing unnecessary chaos in the lamentable Brexit procedure" and the Times, close to the Conservatives, highlights the embarrassment of British diplomats to be led by a minister "who behaves like a child"38.

On 9 July 2018, in disagreement with the conduct of a moderate Brexit ("soft Brexit"), he announced his departure from the government39, as did the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis the day before. He was replaced by Jeremy Hunt.

Succession of Theresa May[edit| code]

Boris Johnson's stance in favour of a "hard" exit from the European Union ("hard Brexit") has made him a potential candidate to succeed him at 10 Downing Street40. In June 2019, following the resignation of Theresa May, he was a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party41. He clearly came out ahead in the first four rounds of the party's MPs' vote and qualified for the members' vote at the end of the fifth round, with 160 votes against 77 for Jeremy Hunt and 75 for Michael Gove42.

Unlike his opponent, he promises not to postpone Brexit beyond 31 October 2019 and says he is ready not to pay the Brexit bill (between 40 and 45 billion euros) if the European Union does not grant better exit conditions to the United Kingdom43.

In this race, he obtained the support of US President Donald Trump, to whom the press often compared him for his atypical positions and style44,45.

On 23 July 2019, the party announced that it had won the membership vote with 66.1% of the vote. He succeeded Theresa May as Prime Minister the following day.46 He thus became the first Catholic to hold this office1,2.

Prime Minister[edit| amend code]
Deadlock in the House of Commons[edit| amend code]

Boris Johnson with Donald Trump (September 2019).
In his first speech at 10 Downing Street, Boris Johnson reaffirms his desire to achieve Brexit on 31st October 201947. His government, appointed the same day, is largely composed of Eurosceptic figures. A dozen of Theresa May's ministers were not reappointed48,49,50.

On 28 August, he obtained from Queen Elizabeth II the suspension of Parliament until 14 October, which could make possible a Brexit without an agreement with the EU or lead to the overthrow of the government and the organisation of early elections51,52. On 3 September, following the defection of Europhile Conservative MP Phillip Lee, he lost his absolute majority in the House of Commons53. On 24 September, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that the suspension of Parliament was "illegal, null and void"54. The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, then called for Johnson's resignation55. This political instability revived the desire for independence of some Scots56, who were mostly hostile to Brexit57.

An agreement was finally reached on 17 October between the United Kingdom and the European Union58. Called to vote on this treaty on 19 October, while the forecasts point in the direction of a adoption of the agreement, the House of Commons adopts an amendment postponing sine die the vote, to be able to examine the text in detail without risking a Brexit without agreement. Boris Johnson then asked the European institutions for a further postponement in an unsigned letter, assuring that he would do everything to ensure that the country leaves the EU on 31 October59. The other 27 EU member states agree to postpone the UK's withdrawal date once again, to 31 January 202060.

2019 early elections[edit| amend code]

Showing his wish to achieve Brexit "at all costs"61, Boris Johnson managed, after three failures, to convince the Labour opposition to support the calling of a new general election62. Being legally unable to complete Brexit by 31 October as he had initially promised, he apologized to members of the Conservative Party63. He also announced that he would refuse any alliance with the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage64,65. Boris Johnson focuses his speech on Brexit – with the slogan "Get Brexit done" – and warns against the possibility of a minority government, which would plunge the country into a new political crisis66.

On election night, on December 12, 2019, he was re-elected MP and the Conservative Party reached an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons, obtaining its best score since 198767.

Brexit and transition period[edit| amend code]

The House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement concluded with the European Union on 9 January 2020, by 330 votes to 23168. As expected, Brexit occurs on 31 January 2020 at 23:00 (UTC)69. Unlike the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, who celebrates the event with fervor, Boris Johnson wants to be "unifying" by addressing supporters of remaining in the EU and taking note of the transition period, which is due to last until 31 December 202070.

Defence policy[edit| amend code]
Boris Johnson announced in November 2020 his decision to increase the budget of the British army by 10% (or £16.5 billion) for the next four years. This was about £41.5 billion a year. The Prime Minister said: "We have decided that the era of budget cuts is over. [These additional sums] will allow us to post military spending of at least 2.2% of our gross domestic product [GDP]: this is more than our commitment to NATO, more than any other European country and any other country in the Atlantic Alliance, except the United States.71 In 2021, the government decided to increase its stockpile of nuclear warheads by 45% (from 180 to 260), after the publication of a government report on foreign policy presenting Russia as the main threat to the United Kingdom72.

In April 2022, Citizen Lab published a report alleging that the UAE is suspected of orchestrating spyware attacks including using Pegasus against 10 Downing Street and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2020 and 202173.

Global Britain and foreign policy[edit| code]
One of the arguments in favor of Brexit, mentioned by Boris Johnson when he was not yet Prime Minister, was the possibility for the United Kingdom, which left the European Union, to broaden its economic and political horizon on a global scale and in particular to the countries of the Commonwealth. This political vision is called "Global Britain" and Boris Johnson, now Prime Minister, tried to implement it.

In 2018, in a few words, the newspaper La Tribune defined Global Britain as a desire to reconnect with the capitalist spirit of the Victorian British Empire by creating a "Singapore-on-Thames", supported by the Commonwealth and driven by the demographic and economic growth of emerging countries, all without the constraints of European regulations74.

On 2 February 2020, during a speech in London, Boris Johnson evoked his vision of Brexit, a vision he developed in March of the same year by setting the government's objectives for 2030 in a document evoking security, defence, development and foreign policy75.

Liz Truss, as Secretary of State for International Trade from July 2019 to September 2021, is the one who will concretely try to implement this policy under Boris Johnson.

As a first step, a series of agreements, extending those signed while the United Kingdom is in the European Union, are signed (South Korea on August 22, 2019, Morocco on October 26, 2019, Egypt on December 5, 2020, Canada on November 22, 202076, Singapore on December 10, 2020 etc.). Some of these agreements are the result of negotiations undertaken during Theresa May's mandate.

Covid-19 pandemic[edit| code]

From the beginning of 2020, Boris Johnson is confronted, like other European leaders, with the Covid-19 pandemic.

It first decides on non-binding measures, according to its scientific advisers, who oppose strict containment and favor the concept of herd immunity77. Until March, he minimized the danger and personally neglected barrier gestures78. Nevertheless, schools were closed on 20 March79, followed by pubs, cinemas and restaurants the following day80. The general lockdown of the country is decreed on March 23, 81.

On 27 March, Boris Johnson announced that he had gone into isolation at 10 Downing Street after testing positive for the Covid-1982 virus. Officially presenting mild symptoms, he says he continues to lead the government via video conference. But on 5 April he was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital; the next day, he was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on oxygen for three days: he then asked Dominic Raab, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and First Secretary of State, to replace him "where necessary"78, but without having the same powers83. On 12 April, he was discharged from hospital and thanked the NHS for "saving his life"84. He resumed his activities after two weeks of convalescence.85 His predecessors David Lloyd George, who suffered from the Spanish flu in 1918, and Winston Churchill, who suffered a stroke in 1953, had also been diminished in the performance of their duties, but their state of health had been concealed.86

His chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, then came under heavy criticism after he travelled with his family to Durham during the strict lockdown while suffering from symptoms of Covid-19. Cummings and Johnson rejected widespread calls for his resignation.87 The scandal led to a loss of confidence in the government and its handling of the pandemic, called the "Cummings effect" in a study published by The Lancet.


Boris Johnson at a G7 meeting by videoconference, February 19, 2021.
In December 2020, Covid-19 cases across the country are rising dramatically, putting additional pressure on intensive care units and hospitals. In response, the government put in place additional restrictions in large parts of southern and eastern England. A third UK-wide lockdown was announced on 4 January 2021 and the government began imposing quarantine procedures on the arrival of UK and foreign nationals in the country. At the same time, Johnson said he was "deeply sorry" and took "full responsibility" for the fact that the UK had become the first country to surpass the sad 100,000 Covid-1988 death mark.

On 8 December 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to begin its Covid-1989 vaccination programme. Half of British adults received at least one first dose of vaccine before March 20, 2021, including Boris Johnson himself with the AstraZeneca vaccine. On April 12, the terraces of bars, restaurants and other businesses reopen with restrictions90. The following day, the United Kingdom reached its goal of offering at least one first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all over 50s and to the most vulnerable or exposed people a little ahead of schedule: more than 32 million people have received at least one first dose. At the same time, studies indicate that the variant of the B.1.1.7 virus, nicknamed "English variant", does not lead to more severe forms of the virus: these findings contradict previous research, but confirm that the English variant is much more contagious than previous strains of Covid-1991.

War in Ukraine[edit| code]
It was while Boris Johnson was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom that Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, under his leadership, his country was a staunch supporter of Ukraine.

Economic crisis and inflation[edit| code]

From November 30, 2021, the date of the revelations of the tabloid The Daily Mirror, Boris Johnson is confronted with the case of Partygate, a term coined by the press to designate the political scandal related to illegal gatherings in 2020 and 2021, on the part of members of the government, while the authorities apply several health restrictions to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. These include several parties organized at 10 Downing Street by people close to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He participated in one of these parties in 202092,93. On a few occasions, 30 to 40 people are said to have gathered at these parties, whether at 10 Downing Street or other British government buildings.94 According to The Telegraph, a party at 10 Downing Street ended "in the early morning" while Queen Elizabeth II attended alone the funeral of her husband, Prince Philip, who died on April 9, 202195. Johnson takes responsibility for these failures and issues a public apology.96,97 Partially implicated by an administrative report by civil servant Sue Gray, he refused to resign.98,99,100 On 6 June 2022, submitted to a vote of confidence by Conservative MPs, Boris Johnson managed to keep his post but nevertheless emerged weakened: 211 MPs voted for his retention in office, and 148 against 101,102.

Other controversies appeared during Boris Johnson's term of office and contributed to discrediting him, notably concerning the amount of the renovation of the Prime Minister's office apartment and sex scandals involving several Conservative MPs as well as a member of the government, the Deputy Chief Whip of Commons and Treasurer of the Royal Court Christopher Pincher103, 104.

On 5 July 2022, two members of the Prime Minister's Cabinet resigned, namely Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer (in charge of Finance) and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Sajid Javid, who indicated that he had "no confidence in this leadership" following a series of scandals105,106. The next day, about twenty other members of the government announced that they were leaving it, expressing their profound disagreement with the policy pursued by Boris Johnson, but the Prime Minister ruled out resigning107.

The Times notes that his fee expectations are "high" and that he "does not accept all offers." His first lecture, given at the Insurance Leadership Forum in Colorado Springs (United States) a few weeks after leaving office as Prime Minister, earned him $150,00011.117
